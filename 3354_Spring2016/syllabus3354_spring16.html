<h3> Course outline </h3>

This course introduces basic structures of modern algebra: groups,
rings and fields. Approximately the first 4 weeks of the course will be
devoted to elementary number-theoretic topics:
greatest common divisor, unique factorization theorem, congruences etc.
You should be familiar with many of these from high school, but we will
study them at a more sophisticated level. The references for this part are
Sections 21-23 of Pinter's book, Chapter 2 of Gilbert's book and online lectures 1-9.
The core part of the course (about 7 weeks) is concerned with group theory. The references for this part
are Sections 3-5, 7-11, 13-16 of Pinter's book, Chapters 3 and 4 of Gilbert's book and online lectures 10-23.
In the last 3-4 classes we will discuss selected topics from ring theory. The references for this part are
Sections 17-20, 24-25 of Pinter's book, Chapters 5 and 6 of Gilbert's book and online lectures 24-27.
I will assume familiarity with basic properties of sets and functions (the references for this part are Sections 2 and 6 of Pinter's book and Chapter 1 of Gilbert's book). You should read this material on your own in the first 2-3 weeks and ask me questions about unclear points.

<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A note on proofs</span>. MATH 3354 is
a proof-based course. Everything we discuss in class will be rigorously
proved. More importantly, you are expected not only to understand
proofs, but also to learn how to construct your own proofs and how to
write proofs&nbsp; (so that others can understand your argument). It is not expected that you
have taken a proof-based course before MATH 3354. However, MATH 3354
will not include any lectures devoted specifically to proof writing; instead you will be expected to
develop this skill gradually as we progress through the material. If
you feel that you need a more detailed introduction to proof writing, you should consider taking MATH 3000
(Transition to Higher Mathematics) before or concurrently with MATH 3354. MATH 3000 is offered this semester
and will meet TuTh 9:30-10:45am. <i> An assessment exam will be administered at the beginning of the semester to
help you make the decision about MATH 3000 </i>.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A note on linear algebra</span>. The
only official prerequisite for this course is MATH 1320. However, you
are <span style="font-style: italic;">strongly encouraged </span>to
take <span style="font-weight: bold;">linear algebra</span> (MATH 3351
or APMA 3080) before or concurrently with MATH 3354. The only formal
linear algebra skill that will be needed in MATH 3354 is the ability to add and
multiply matrices (this is covered, for instance, in Section 1.6 of Gilbert's
book). However, some of the mateiral&nbsp; in
MATH 3354 is based on the ideas, which also appear in linear
algebra, but in less abstract setting. Thus, having taken linear
algebra may help you better understand some of the topics in MATH 3354.<br>

<h3>Evaluation </h3> The course grade will be based on homework, two midterms and the final (all in-class),
with weights distributed as follows:
<ul>
<li> homework: 15% 
<li> midterms: 20% each
<li> final: 45%
</ul>

<h3>Exams</h3>

The midterm dates given below are tentative and may be changed later. The date and time of the final
exam is determined by the registrar and cannot be changed. 
<ul>

  <li> First midterm exam: Tue, Mar 1st 

  <li> Second midterm exam: Thu, Apr 14th

  <li> Final exam: Fri, May 6th, 9am-12pm

</ul>

<h3>Make-up policy </h3>

<ul>

  <li>Make-ups will be given only under extreme circumstances (such as serious illness). Except for emergencies, you must obtain my permission for a make-up before the exam. </li>

  <li>If you miss an in-class exam or fail to submit a take-home exam
by the due date without a compelling reason, you will
be assigned the score of <b>0</b> on that exam. </li>

  <li>University regulations specifically prohibit early make-ups. <br>

    <br>

  </li>

</ul>

<h3> Homework </h3> 

<ul> 
<li> Homework will be assigned weekly and will usually be due on Thursday. </li>
<li> Please STAPLE your homework. </li>
<li> No late homework will be accepted. However, three lowest
homework scores will be dropped. </li>
<li> GRADING: it will not be possible to grade all homework problems. In each assignment 3-4 selected (but not announced in advance) problems will be graded for credit. 
</ul>


<h3> Collaboration policy on homework. </h3> 
<ul>
<li> You are welcome (and even encouraged) 
to work on homework together, but you <i>must</i> write
up solutions independently, in your own words. In particular,
you <b>should not be consulting others during the process of
writing down your solution </b>.
</ul>




<h3> Announcements</h3>

Major announcements will be made in class and also posted on the course

webpage.

Some other announcements may only be made by e-mail, so check your

e-mail account

regularly.

<h3> Add/drop/withdrawal dates: </h3>

<ul>

  <li>Monday, February 3 -- Last day to ADD a course, elect the audit

option,

change the grading option (grade or CR/NC), or establish an independent

study </li>

  <li>Tuesday, February 4 -- Last day to DROP a course (deletion

from the transcript) </li>

  <li>Wednesday, March 16 -- Last day to withdraw from a course
 </li>

</ul>

<br>
<br>
All students with special needs requiring accommodations should present the appropriate paperwork from
the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC). It is the student's responsibility to present this paperwork in a
timely fashion and follow up with the instructor about the accommodations being offered.  Accommodations
for test-taking (e.g., extended time) should be arranged at least 5 business days before an exam.
