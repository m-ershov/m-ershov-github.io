<h2>Syllabus for Math 8852 (Spring 2013). </h2>

<h3> Unitary representations and Kazhdan's property (T) </h3>

The course will start with a brief introduction to the theory of unitary representations of groups
(about 5.5 weeks), after which we will turn to Kazhdan's property (T) and its applications 
(about 7.5 weeks). Below is a very tentative list of main topics I am going to discuss: 
<br>
<br>
 1.&nbsp; Some generalities on unitary representations <br>
 2.&nbsp; Unitary representations of compact groups <br>
 3.&nbsp; Unitary representations of abelian groups <br>
 4.&nbsp; Unitary representations of SL_2(R) and the Heisenberg group <br> 
 5.&nbsp; Kazhdan's property (T): definition(s) and basic properties <br>
 6.&nbsp; Kazhdan's property (T) and affine isometric actions (property (FH))<br>
 7.&nbsp; Relative property (T) <br>
 8.&nbsp; Property (T) for SL_n(Z), n>=3 <br>
 9.&nbsp; Spectral criteria for property (T) <br>
10.&nbsp; Property (T) and amenability <br>

<br>
The above list will likely be continuously adjusted throughout the semester depending
on how fast we go and on the audience interests.
<br>
<br>

<b> Prerequisites: </b> I will try to make the course as self-contained as possible.
The main prerequisites (in addition to first year graduate courses) are some exposure
to representation theory of finite groups (at the level of Algebra-III) and basic theory of
Hilbert spaces, including spectral measures and spectral theorems (at the level of Functional Analysis-I), 
but even these are not strict requirements if you are willing to do some extra reading on 
your own and possibly assume some facts for granted.
<br>
<br>
<b> References: </b> The main book for the course is  `Kazhdan's Property (T)'
by B. Bekka, P. de la Harpe and A. Valette, a preprint version of which is freely available 
<a href="http://perso.univ-rennes1.fr/bachir.bekka/KazhdanTotal.pdf"> here </a>.
Other references will be provided as we progress through the material.
<br>
<br>
<b> Required work: </b> There will be regular homework assignments (approximately every other week).
Problems will not be due in written form; instead we will have a problem session (about 90 minutes long)
after each assignment where solutions will be presented by students. If you are taking this course
for a grade, you are expected to participate in those presentations on the regular basis, but all students 
sitting  in the class are strongly encouraged to work on the assigned problems.
