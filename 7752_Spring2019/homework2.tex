{\bf Problem 0.} Read the section on graded algebras from online Lecture 5
before the class on Tuesday, Jan 29.
\vskip .1cm

{\bf Problem 1.} Let $R$ be a commutative ring.
An $R$-module $M$ is called {\it torsion} if for any $m\in M$
there exists nonzero $r\in R$ such that $rm=0$. An $R$-module $M$ is called {\it divisible} 
if for any nonzero $r\in R$ we have $rM=M$. In other words, $M$ is divisible if
for any $m\in M$ and nonzero $r\in R$ there exists $x\in M$ such that $rx=m$.

(a) Suppose that $M$ is a torsion $R$-module and $N$ is a divisible $R$-module.
Prove that $M\otimes_R N =\{0\}$.

(b) Let $M=\dbQ/\dbZ$ considered as a $\dbZ$-module. Prove that
$M\otimes _{\dbZ} M=\{0\}$.

{\bf Problem 2.} Let $R$ be a commutative ring, $\{N_{\alpha}\}$ a collection
of $R$-modules and $M$ another $R$-module.

(a) (practice, [DF, problem 14, p.376 ]) Prove that $M\otimes (\oplus N_{\alpha})\cong \oplus (M\otimes N_{\alpha})$ as $R$-modules (tensor products are over $R$).

(b) (see [DF, problem 15, p. 376]) Show by example that $M\otimes (\prod N_{\alpha})$ need not be isomorphic to $\prod (M\otimes N_{\alpha})$. {\bf Hint:} Use the result of one of the previous problems on p. 376.

\bf{Problem 3. }\rm Let $R$ be a commutative domain, and let $M$ be a free 
$R$-module with basis $e_1,\ldots, e_k$. Prove that the element
$e_1\otimes e_2+e_2\otimes e_1\in M\otimes M$ is not representable as a simple tensor
$m\otimes n$ for some $m,n\in M$.
\skv
\bf{Problem 4. }\rm Problem 16 on p.376 of DF
\skv
\bf{Problem 5. }\rm Problem 17 on pp.376-377 of DF. 
\skv
\bf{Problem 6. }\rm (practice) Problem 21 on p.377 of DF
\skv
\bf{Problem 7. }\rm Let $R$ be a commutative ring with $1$, let $S$ and $B$ be $R$-algebras,
and suppose that $S$ is commutative. Then $S\otimes_R B$ is an $R$-algebra (and in particular a ring) and also an $S$-module via the extension of scalars construction (type I tensor product). Prove that $S\otimes_R B$ is also an $S$-algebra.
\skv
\newpage


{\bf Problem 8.} Problem 25 on pp. 377 of DF (the $S$-algebra structure on $S\otimes_R R[x]$ is described
in Problem~7).

\skv
\bf{Problem 9. }\rm (a) Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space over $\dbC$
(complex numbers). Note that $V$ can also be considered as a vector space over $\dbR$,
but $\dim_{\dbR} (V)=2 \dim_{\dbC}(V)$. Prove that $V\otimes_{\dbC} V$ is not isomorphic
to $V\otimes_{\dbR} V$ as vector spaces over $\dbR$ and compute their dimensions over $\dbR$.

(b) Let $R$ be an integral domain and $F$ its field of fractions. Prove that
$F\otimes_{R} F\cong F\otimes_{F} F\cong F$ as $F$-algebras (again the $F$-algebra structure on
structure on $F\otimes_{R} F$ is described in Problem~7).
