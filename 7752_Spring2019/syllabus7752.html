<h3>Main Text: </h3>   
<i>Abstract Algebra</i>, David Dummit and Richard Foote, 3rd edition. 

<h3> Prerequisites: </h3>  Math 7751 and an undergraduate course in linear algebra 
comparable in level to UVA 4651.
<br>



<h3> Course content: </h3>  The first part of the semester (5-6 weeks) will be devoted to modules and multilinear algebra. The material we will cover is mostly contained
in Chapters 10-12 of Dummit and Foote. I will assume familiarity with the content of 
Sections 11.1-11.4 as they contain material covered in standard undergraduate linear algebra
courses. Next we will study fields and Galois theory (also 5-6 weeks).
The material we will cover is mostly discussed in Chapters 13-14 of Dummit and Foote,
though the order of my exposition will be quite different and closer to Lang's
book ``Algebra''. If time allows,  we will finish with a brief introduction to either commutative algebra (parts of Chapter 15 of Dummit and Foote)
or representation theory (parts of Chapters 18 and/or 19 of Dummit and Foote).

<h3> Exams and homework: </h3> There will be weekly homework and three exams (two midterms and the final). The format of the exams will be determined later; the current plan is that one of the midterms will be take-home while the other midterm and the final will be in-class. Tentative dates of the exams are as follows:

<h3>Exams</h3>
<ul>
<li> First midterm exam: Tue, February 26th
<li> Second midterm exam: Fri, April 12th
<li> Final exam: Thu, May 2nd, 9am-12pm
</ul>

<h3> Evaluation:
</h3> 
<ul>
<li> Final exam: 30%
<li> Midterm exams: 20% each
<li> Homework: 30%
</ul>
</ul>
<h3> Homework </h3> 

<ul> 
<li> Homework will be assigned weekly and will usually be due on Thursday. </li>
<li> Please STAPLE your homework. </li>
<li> No late homework will be accepted. However, the lowest
homework score will be dropped; in addition, the lowest score on each assignment will be dropped </li>
<li> GRADING: it will not be possible to grade all homework problems. 
</ul>




<h3> Collaboration policy. </h3> 
<ul>
<li> On homework:  you are welcome (and even encouraged) 
to work on homework together, but you <i>must</i> write
up solutions independently, in your own words. In particular,
you <b> should not be consulting others during the process of
writing down your solution. </b>

<li> On exams: you may not discuss exam problems with others.
</ul>

<h3> Announcements</h3>

Major announcements will be made in class and also posted on the course

webpage.

Some other announcements may only be made by e-mail, so check your

e-mail account

regularly.

<h3> Add/drop/withdrawal dates: </h3>

<ul>

  <li>Monday, January 28 -- Last day to ADD a course, elect the audit

option,

change the grading option (grade or CR/NC), or establish an independent

study </li>

  <li>Tuesday, January 29 -- Last day to DROP a course (deletion

from the transcript) </li>

  <li>Monday, March 18 -- Last day to withdraw from a course

<h3> SDAC </h3>

All students with special needs requiring accommodations should present the appropriate paperwork from
the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC). It is the student's responsibility to present this paperwork in a
timely fashion and follow up with the instructor about the accommodations being offered.  Accommodations
for test-taking (e.g., extended time) should be arranged at least 5 business days before an exam.
