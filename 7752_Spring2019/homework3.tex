\bf{Problem 1. }\rm The main goal of this problem is to classify
$2$-dimensional $\dbR$-algebras ($\dbR$=reals), that is,
$\dbR$-algebras which are 2-dimensional as vector spaces over $\dbR$.
\skv
Let $F$ be a field with ${\rm char}(F)\neq 2$, and
let $A$ be a $2$-dimensional $F$-algebra with $1$.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Let $u\in A$ be any element which is not an $F$-multiple of $1$.
Prove that
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] $u$ generates $A$ as an $F$-algebra, that is, the minimal $F$-subalgebra of $A$ containing $u$ and $1$ is $A$ itself.
\item[(ii)] $u$ satisfies a quadratic equation $au^2+bu+c=0$
for some $a,b,c\in F$ with $a\neq 0$.
\end{itemize}
\item[(b)] Show that there exists $v\in A$ such that $v^2\in F$.
{\bf Hint:} take any $u$ as in (a), and look for $v$ of the form
$u+\beta$ with $\beta\in F$.
\item[(c)] Deduce from (b) that $A$ is isomorphic as an $F$-algebra
to  $F[x]/(x^2-c)$ for some $c\in F$. 
\item[(d)] Prove that if $c=d^2$ for some $d\in F\setminus\{0\}$, then $F[x]/(x^2-c)\cong F\times F$.
\item[(e)] Now let $F=\dbR$ (real numbers). Prove that in (c) one can choose
$c=0,1$ or $-1$. Then prove that the algebras $\dbR[x]/(x^2+1)$, $\dbR[x]/(x^2-1)$ and $\dbR[x]/(x^2)$ 
are pairwise non-isomorphic. {\bf Hint:} the algebras can be distinguished from
each other by simple abstract properties.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Problem 2.} Let $R$ be a commutative ring with $1$ and let 
$M,N$ and $L$ be $R$-modules. Let $Bil_R(M\times N,L)$ be the set of
all $R$-bilinear maps from $M\times N$ to $L$

\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] The main theorem from Lecture~4 asserts that
$Bil_R(M\times N,L)$ is isomorphic to $Hom_R(M\otimes N,L)$ as abelian groups. Define a natural $R$-algebra structure on $Bil_R(M\times N,L)$ and prove that $Bil_R(M\times N,L)$ is isomorphic to $Hom_R(M\otimes N,L)$ as $R$-modules.

\item[(b)] Now prove that $Bil_R(M\times N,L)$ is isomorphic to
$Hom_R(M,Hom_R(N,L))$ as $R$-modules.
\end{itemize}
Note that (a) and (b) imply that $Hom_R(M\otimes N,L)\cong Hom_R(M,Hom_R(N,L))$ as $R$-modules.
\skv

{\bf Problem 3. } Let $V$ and $W$ be finite dimensional vector spaces
over a field $F$, let $\{v_1,\ldots, v_n\}$ be a basis of $V$
and $\{w_1,\ldots, w_m\}$ a basis of $W$.

Let  $\phi: V\otimes_F W\to Mat_{n\times m}(F)$ be the
$F$-linear transformation such that $\phi(v_i\otimes w_j)=e_{ij}$
where $e_{ij}$ is the matrix whose $(i,j)$-entry is equal to $1$ and all
other entries are equal to $0$ (note that such transformation
exists and is unique because $\{v_i\otimes w_j : 1\leq i\leq n, 1\leq j\leq m\}$
is a basis for $V\otimes_F W$; furthermore, $\phi$ is an isomorphism
since matrices $\{e_{ij}\}$ form a basis of $Mat_{n\times m}(F)$).

Prove that for a matrix $A\in Mat_{n\times m}(F)$ the following are equivalent:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] $A=\phi(v\otimes w)$ for some $v\in V, w\in W$ (note: $v$ and $w$
need not be elements of the above bases)

\item[(b)] $rk(A)\leq 1$.
\end{itemize}
Note that this problem yields a one-line solution to Problem~3 from HW\#2.
\skv

{\bf Problem 4 (practice).} Let $R=\oplus_{n=0}^{\infty} R_n$ be a graded ring.
An element $r\in R$ is called \emph{homogeneous} if $r\in R_n$
for some $n$. 

\sk Any $r\in R$ can be uniquely written as $r=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} r_n$
where $r_n\in R_n$ and only finitely many $r_n$'s are nonzero. The elements
$\{r_n\}$ are called the \emph{homogeneous components of $r$}.

(a) Let $I$ be an ideal of $R$. Prove that the following are equivalent:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] $I$ is a graded ideal, that is, $I=\oplus_{n=0}^{\infty} I\cap R_n$  
\item[(ii)] For each $r\in I$ all homogeneous components of $r$ also lie in $I$
\end{itemize}

(b) Let $I$ be an ideal of $R$ generated by homogeneous elements
(possibly of different degrees). Prove that $I$ is graded.

\skv
{\bf Problem 5.} $\empty$
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Let $R$ be a commutative ring with $1$ and $M$ an $R-module$.
Let $m_1,\ldots, m_k$ be elements of $M$ and $\sigma\in S_k$ a permutation.
Prove that $m_{\sigma(1)}\wedge\ldots\wedge m_{\sigma(k)}=(-1)^{\sigma}
m_1\ldots m_k$.
\item[(b)] Use (a) to prove Proposition~6.5 from the online version of Lecture~6.
\end{itemize}
