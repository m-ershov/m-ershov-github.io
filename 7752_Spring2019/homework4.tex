{\bf Note on hints:} All hints are given at the end of the assignment, each on a separate page.
Problems (or parts of problems) for which hint is available are marked with *.
\vskip .1cm

{\bf Problem 1*.} Prove Theorem~N1 from Lecture 8: Let $R$ be a ring (with 1), let $M$ be an $R$-module
and $N$ its submodule. Prove that $M$ is Noetherian $\iff$
$N$ and $M/N$ are both Noetherian.
\skv

{\bf Problem 2.} Let $A$ be a ring (with 1). A subring $B$ of $A$ is called a
\emph{retract} if there exists a surjective ring homomorphism
$\phi: A\to B$ such that $\phi_{| B}=id_B$, that is, $\phi(b)=b$ for all $b\in B$.

Now let $M$ and $N$ be two $R$-modules. Prove that the tensor algebra
$T(M)$ is (naturally isomorphic to) a subalgebra of $T(M\oplus N)$ and that this subalgebra is a retract. Also prove the analogous statement about the symmetric algebras.

\skv
{\bf Problem 3:} \rm Define the rank of an $R$-module $M$, denoted by $\rk(M)$, to be the minimal number of generators (WARNING: this definition is different from the definition in DF; the two definitions coincide for free modules over commutative rings).
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)*] Let $R$ be a PID,
$M$ be a finitely generated $R$-module and
$R/a_1R\oplus \ldots \oplus R/a_mR\oplus R^s$ its invariant factor
decomposition, that is, $a_1,\ldots, a_m$ are nonzero 
non-units and $a_1\mid a_2\mid\ldots\mid a_m$. Prove that
$\rk(M)=m+s$. {\bf Warning:} It is not true in general that
$\rk(P\oplus Q)=\rk(P)+\rk(Q)$. 

\item[(b)] Again let $R$ be a PID. Let $F$ be a free $R$-module of rank $n$ with basis 
$e_1,\ldots, e_n$, let $N$ be the submodule of $F$
generated by some elements $v_1,\ldots, v_n\in F$,
and let $A\in Mat_n(F)$ be the matrix such that
$$\left(\begin{array}{c} v_1 \\ \vdots \\ v_n\end{array}\right)=
A \left(\begin{array}{c} e_1 \\ \vdots \\ e_n\end{array}\right)$$ 
Find a simple condition on the entries of $A$ which holds
if and only if $\rk(F/N)=n$.
\end{itemize}
\skv
{\bf Problem 4}. Let $R=\mathbb R[x]$, $F=R^3$ (the standard 3-dimensional $R$-module)
and $N$ the $R$-submodule of $F$
generated by $(1-x,1,0)$, $(-2,4-x,0)$ and $(1,-5,-x)$.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Find compatible bases for $F$ and $N$, that is, bases satisfying the conclusion
of the submodule structure theorem. {\bf Note:} an algorithm for computing such bases is given in Lecture~8.
\item[(b)] Describe the quotient module $F/N$ in IF and ED forms.
\end{itemize}
\skv
{\bf Problem 5:} Let $R$ be a commutative ring (with 1).
\skv
(a) Let $C$ be an $R$-algebra and let $A$ and $B$ be $R$-subalgebras of $C$
which commute with each other, that is, $ab=ba$ for any $a\in A, b\in B$
(note that $A$ and $B$ themselves do not have to be commutative).
Prove that there is an \underline{$R$-algebra homomorphism} $\phi:A\otimes_R B\to C$
such that $\phi(a\otimes b)=ab$ for each $a\in A$ and $b\in B$.
\skv
(b)* Now assume that $R$ is a field, and let $A$ be a finite-dimensional
$R$-algebra. Prove that the algebra $A\otimes_R A$ cannot be a field
unless $\dim_R A=1$. 
\newpage

{\bf Hint for 1:} The forward direction is easy. For the backwards direction,
observe that if $\{P_i\}$ is an ascending chain of submodules of $M$,
then $\{P_i\cap N\}$ is an ascending chain of submodules of $N$
and $\{(P_i+N)/N\}$ is an ascending chain of submodules of $M/N$.

\newpage


{\bf Hint for 3(a):} Let $p$ be a prime
dividing $a_1$. How is $M$ related to $M'=(R/pR)^{m+s}$
and what is $\rk(M')$ (and why)?

\newpage

{\bf Hint for 5(b):} use 5(a).
