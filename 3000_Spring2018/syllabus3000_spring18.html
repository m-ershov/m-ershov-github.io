<h3> Course outline </h3>

As the title indicates, Math 3000 is designed to provide a transition from computation-oriented classes like calculus to proof-based classes like Math 3310 Basic Real Analysis and Math 3354 Survey of Algebra. Unlike the majority of math classes, Math 3000 will not concentrate on a specific area of mathematics, and its main goal is to develop skills for <b>constructing and writing rigorous mathematical proofs.</b> The main topics we will discuss include 
<ul>
<li> sets
<li> functions
<li> cardinality
<li> general proof techniques
<li> elementary number theory
<li> elementary counting problems 
</ul>



<h3>Evaluation </h3> The course grade will be based on homework, two midterms and the final (all in-class),
with weights distributed as follows:
<ul>
<li> homework: 18%
<li> midterms: 20% each
<li> final: 42%
</ul>

<h3>Exams</h3>

The midterm dates given below are tentative and may be changed later. The date and time of the final
exam is determined by the registrar and cannot be changed. 
<ul>

  <li> First midterm exam: Tue, Feb 27th 

  <li> Second midterm exam: Thu, Apr 12th

  <li> Final exam: Thu, May 10th, 9am-12pm

</ul>

<h3>Make-up policy for exams</h3>

<ul>

  <li>Make-ups will be given only under extreme circumstances (such as serious illness). Except for emergencies, you must obtain my permission for a make-up before the exam. </li>

  <li>If you miss an exam without a compelling reason, you will
be assigned the score of <b>0</b> on that exam. </li>

  <li>University regulations specifically prohibit early make-ups. <br>

    <br>

  </li>

</ul>

<h3> Homework </h3> 

<ul> 
<li> Homework will be assigned weekly and will usually be due by 1pm on Fridays in the TA's mailbox. </li>
<li> DO NOT slide your homework under my office door. </li>
<li> UNSTAPLED homework will not be accepted. </li>
<li> No late homework will be accepted. However, two lowest
homework scores will be dropped. </li>
<li> GRADING: most likely it will not be possible to grade all homework problems. 
</ul>


<h3> Collaboration policy on homework. </h3> 
<ul>
<li> You are welcome (and even encouraged) 
to work on homework together, but you <i>must</i> write
up solutions independently, in your own words. In particular,
you <b>should not be consulting others during the process of
writing down your solution </b>.
</ul>



<h3> Announcements</h3>

Major announcements will be made in class and also posted on the course

webpage.

Some other announcements may only be made by e-mail, so check your

e-mail account

regularly.

<h3> Add/drop/withdrawal dates: </h3>

<ul>

  <li>Wednesday, January 31 -- Last day to ADD a course, elect the audit

option,

change the grading option (grade or CR/NC), or establish an independent

study </li>

  <li>Thursday, February 1 -- Last day to DROP a course (deletion

from the transcript) </li>

  <li>Wednesday, March 14 -- Last day to withdraw from a course
 </li>

</ul>
<h3> Math Tutoring Center </h3>
Math Tutoring Center (MTC) will provide (free) tutoring for Math 3000. The tutoring sessions for Math 3000 will meet Sun 2-3pm, Tue 4-5pm and Thu 8:15-9:30pm.
The complete MTC schedule is available <a href="http://people.virginia.edu/~psb7p/MTCsch.html">here</a>.


<br>
<h3> SDAC </h3>

All students with special needs requiring accommodations should present the appropriate paperwork from
the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC). It is the student's responsibility to present this paperwork in a
timely fashion and follow up with the instructor about the accommodations being offered.  Accommodations
for test-taking (e.g., extended time) should be arranged at least 5 business days before an exam.
