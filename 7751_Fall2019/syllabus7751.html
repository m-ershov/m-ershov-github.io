<h4>Main Text:    
<i>Abstract Algebra</i>, David Dummit and Richard Foote, 3rd edition. </h4>
<h3> Course outline </h3>
 
<h3> Course content: </h3> Math 7751 is the first half of the standard graduate algebra sequence
(the second half is Math 7752). We will study primarily group theory, ring theory and (time permitting) basic commutative algebra.  
<br>
<br>

<h3> Prerequisites: </h3>  Undergraduate courses in linear algebra and abstract algebra
comparable in level to UVA 4651 and 4652, respectively. For more details on your
expected abstract algebra background consult the questionnaire distributed in class. 
Linear algebra material will not be seriously used until 7752, but a linear algebra
assessment exam will be posted during the week before the fall semester. If you feel that 
your linear algebra preparation is not sufficient, you are strongly encouraged to review
the main linear algebra topics before the spring semester begins.

<br>
<br>
<h3> Schedule: </h3> The plan for the fall semester is to start with a very brief review of Chapters 1-3 (first 2 classes) and then cover Chapters 4-9 (some sections containing standard undergraduate material will be skipped or covered very briefly) and 15. Additional topics not covered by Dummit and Foote may be discussed, time permitting.
<br>
<br>


<h3> Exams and homework: </h3> There will be weekly homework and three exams (two midterms and the final). The format of the exams has not been finalized yet, but the current plan is that the first-midterm and the final will be given in class while the second midterm will be take-home. 

<h3>Exams</h3>
<ul>
<li> First midterm exam: Tue, October 1st. 
<li> Second midterm exam: Thu, November 7th. 
<li> Final exam: Mon, December 9th, 9am-12pm.
</ul>

The time and date for the final exam are determined by the registrar and cannot be changed. The dates of the midterm exams are tentative at this point and may be slightly changed. In case of a take-home exam date means the due date.


<h3> Evaluation:
</h3> 
<ul>
<li> Final exam: 30%
<li> Midterm exams: 20% each
<li> Homework: 30%
</ul>
</ul>
<h3> Homework </h3> 

<ul> 
<li> Homework will be assigned weekly and will usually be due on Thursdays. </li>
<li> Please STAPLE your homework. </li>
<li> No late homework will be accepted. However, the lowest homework score will be dropped; in addition, the lowest score on each assignment will be dropped </li>
<li> GRADING: it may not be possible to grade all homework problems. 
</ul>




<h3> Collaboration policy. </h3> 
<ul>
<li> On homework:  you are welcome (and even encouraged) 
to work on homework together, but you <i>must</i> write
up solutions independently, in your own words. In particular,
you <b> should not be consulting others during the process of
writing down your solution. </b>

<li> On exams: you may not discuss exam problems with others.
</ul>

<h3> Announcements</h3>

Major announcements will be made in class and also posted on the course

webpage.

Some other announcements may only be made by e-mail, so check your

e-mail account

regularly.

<h3> Add/drop/withdrawal dates: </h3>

<ul>

  <li>Tuesday, September 10 -- Last day to ADD a course, elect the audit

option,

change the grading option (grade or CR/NC), or establish an independent

study </li>

  <li>Wednesday, September 11 -- Last day to DROP a course (deletion

<h3> SDAC </h3>

All students with special needs requiring accommodations should present the appropriate paperwork from
the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC). It is the student's responsibility to present this paperwork in a
timely fashion and follow up with the instructor about the accommodations being offered.  Accommodations
for test-taking (e.g., extended time) should be arranged at least 5 business days before an exam.
