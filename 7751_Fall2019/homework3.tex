\centerline{\bf Problems, to be submitted by Thursday, September 19th}
\skv
{\bf 1.} Let $G$ be a finite group, $P$ a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$ for some $p$
and $H$ a subgroup of $G$ such that $N_{G}(P)\subseteq H\subseteq G$.
Prove that $N_H(P)=N_G(P)$ and $[G:H]\equiv 1\mod p$.
\skv
{\bf 2.} Prove that a group of order $132=3\cdot 4\cdot 11$ has a normal Sylow $p$-subgroup for some $p$.
\skv
{\bf 3.} Let $G$ be a group of order $48$. Prove that $G$ has either a normal subgroup of order $16$ or normal subgroups of orders $8$ and $24$.
\skv 
{\bf 4.} Let $G$ be a group of order $24$. Prove that $G$ has a normal 
$2$-Sylow subgroup or a normal $3$-Sylow subgroup or is isomorphic to $S_4$. {\bf Note:} This is probably a pretty hard problem without a hint, but we will discuss how to approach it in class on Tue, Sep 17.
\skv
{\bf 5.} Let $\dbF_p$ be a finite field of order $p$, let $G=GL_n(\dbF_p)$ and $P=U_n(\dbF_p)$, the subgroup of upper-unitriangular matrices in $GL_n(\dbF_p)$.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Prove that $P$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$
(you may use the formula for $|G|$ established in Homework\#2).

\item[(b)] Let $B=UT_n(\dbF_p)$, the subgroup of upper-triangular matrices in $G$.
Prove that $N_G(P)=B$ . {\bf Hint: }  To prove the inclusion $N_G(P)\subseteq B$ consider the natural action of $G$ on $X=\dbF_p^n$. First compute $X^P=\{x\in X : gx=x \mbox { for any }g\in P\}$,  the set of fixed points of $P$. Now if $g\in N_G(P)$, what can you say
about $g\cdot X^P$ (the image of $X^P$ under the action of $g$). Use this
result and induction on $n$ to prove that $N_G(P)\subseteq B$.

\item[(c)] Find $n_p(G)$, the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$.
\end{itemize}

{\bf 6.} Explicitly describe a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $S_{p^2}$. See next page for a hint.
\newpage
{\bf Hint for 6:} The largest power of $p$ dividing $(p^2)!$ is $p^{p+1}$. First find a subgroup of order $p^p$
in $S_{p^2}$ (this is quite easy) and then think how to enlarge it to a subgroup of order $p^{p+1}$.
