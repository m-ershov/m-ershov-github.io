<h4>Text: <i>Introduction to Analysis</i>, fourth edition, William Wade. </h4>

<h3> Course outline </h3>

In this course we will rigorously introduce the main concepts of real analysis, including limits,
continuity, differentiability, integrability and series, and prove the main theorems dealing with them
(e.g. Intermediate Value Theorem, Mean Value Theorem and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus).
While all these topics and theorems are discussed in detail in Calculus I and II, not much is
usually being said about their proofs. The goal of this course is not only (and not so much)
to convince you that these theorems are indeed true, but rather to introduce you to the basic
techniques used to prove those theorems and teach you how to apply those techniques to solve other
problems. In particular, you will learn how to work with the ``epsilon-delta'' definition of the limit
which is a fundamental skill for understanding any advanced topics in analysis.
The plan is to cover the majority of material from Chapters 1-6 of Wade's book. I will assume basic 
familiarity with sets and functions (Section 1.5). You should read this section
on your own in the first couple of weeks and ask me questions about unclear points.

<br>
<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">A note on proofs</span>. MATH 3310 is
a proof-based course. Everything we discuss in class will be rigorously
proved. More importantly, you are expected not only to understand
proofs, but also to learn how to construct your own proofs and how to
write proofs&nbsp; (so that others can understand your argument). It is not expected that you
have taken a proof-based course before MATH 3310. However, MATH 3310
will not include any lectures devoted specifically to proof writing; instead you will be expected to
develop this skill gradually as we progress through the material. If
you feel that you need a more detailed introduction to proof writing, I encourage you to take MATH 3000
(Transition to Higher Mathematics) before or concurrently with MATH 3310. MATH 3000 is offered this semester
and will meet MWF 10-10:50am. <i> An assessment exam will be administered at the beginning of the semester to
help you make the decision about MATH 3000 </i>.<br>

<h3>Evaluation </h3> The course grade will be based on homework, two midterms and the final (all in-class),
with weights distributed as follows:
<ul>
<li> homework: 15% 
<li> midterms: 20% each
<li> final: 45%
</ul>

<h3>Exams</h3>

The midterm dates given below are tentative and may be changed later. The date and time of the final
exam is determined by the registrar and cannot be changed. 
<ul>

  <li> First midterm exam: Thu, Feb 19th 

  <li> Second midterm exam: Thu, Apr 2nd

  <li> Final exam: Mon, May 4th, 9am-12pm

</ul>

<h3>Make-up policy </h3>

<ul>

  <li>Make-ups will be given only under extreme circumstances (such as serious illness). Except for emergencies, you must obtain my permission for a make-up before the exam. </li>

  <li>If you miss an in-class exam or fail to submit a take-home exam
by the due date without a compelling reason, you will
be assigned the score of <b>0</b> on that exam. </li>

  <li>University regulations specifically prohibit early make-ups. <br>

    <br>

  </li>

</ul>

<h3> Homework </h3> 

<ul> 
<li> Homework will be assigned weekly and will usually be due on Thursday. </li>
<li> Please STAPLE your homework. </li>
<li> No late homework will be accepted. However, three lowest
homework scores will be dropped. </li>
<li> GRADING: it will not be possible to grade all homework problems. In each assignment 3-4 selected (but not announced in advance) problems will be graded for credit. 
</ul>


<h3> Collaboration policy on homework. </h3> 
<ul>
<li> You are welcome (and even encouraged) 
to work on homework together, but you <i>must</i> write
up solutions independently, in your own words. In particular,
you <b>should not be consulting others during the process of
writing down your solution </b>.
</ul>




<h3> Announcements</h3>

Major announcements will be made in class and also posted on the course

webpage.

Some other announcements may only be made by e-mail, so check your

e-mail account

regularly.

<h3> Add/drop/withdrawal dates: </h3>

<ul>

  <li>Monday, January 26 -- Last day to ADD a course, elect the audit

option,

change the grading option (grade or CR/NC), or establish an independent

study </li>

  <li>Tuesday, January 27 -- Last day to DROP a course (deletion

from the transcript) </li>

  <li>Wednesday, March 18 -- Last day to withdraw from a course
