<h3> References</h3>
There is no official text for the course. Most (but not all) of the
material we will discuss is covered by the following books:

D. Solitar</li>

<h3>Prerequisities </h3>
The course should be accessible to students who have
completed first year graduate courses. The main
prerequisite is a good knowledge of&nbsp; basic group theory at the
level of
Math 7751. However, occasionally we will use results from other areas, including topology (mainly
covering spaces), linear algebra and ring theory.<br>
<h3>Homework and Problem Session<br>
</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Homework will be assigned regularly (most likely weekly)<br>
  </li>
  <li> Approximately every two weeks we will have a problem session
(date and time TBD) where homework problems will be discussed. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Students taking the class for a grade are expected to 
   <ul>
<li> seriously attempt all the assigned problems 
<li> present homework problems during the problem sessions on the regular basis 
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>End of the semester Presentations</h3>
Each student taking the class for a grade must give a 40 minute presentation on a chosen topic at the end of the semester. 
A list of suggested topics will be
provided. You should feel free to choose a different topic (not
from the list), but you need to get my approval. In any case, you should inform me
about your proposed topic no later than the end of March.

<h3> Add/drop/withdrawal dates: </h3>

<ul>

  <li>Wednesday, February 1 -- Last day to add a course, select the AU (audit) option or change to or from "Credit/No Credit" Option</li>

 <li>Thursday, February 2 -- Last day to drop a course</li>


  <li>Wednesday, March 15 -- Last day to withdraw from a course
 </li>

</ul>

<h3> SDAC </h3>

All students with special needs requiring accommodations should present the appropriate paperwork from
the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC). It is the student's responsibility to present this paperwork in a
timely fashion and follow up with the instructor about the accommodations being offered.  Accommodations
for test-taking (e.g., extended time) should be arranged at least 5 business days before an exam.
