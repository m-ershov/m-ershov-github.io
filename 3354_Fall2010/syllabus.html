<h4>Text: <i>Elements of Modern Algebra</i>, seventh edition, Jimmie
Gilbert and Linda Gilbert. </h4>
<h3> Course outline </h3>
This course introduces basic structures of modern algebra: groups,
rings and fields. Approximately first 4 weeks of the course will be
devoted to elementary number-theoretic topics (Chapter 2 of the book):
greatest common divisor, unique factorization theorem, congruences etc.
You should be familiar with most of these from high school, but we will
study them at a more sophisticated level. The core part of the course
(about 7 weeks) is concerned with group theory (Chapters 3 and 4). In
the last 3 weeks we
will discuss selected topics from ring theory (Chapters 5 and 6) and
(if time allows)
some additional topics, possibly not covered by the book (in the latter
case, additional
references or online notes will be provided). I will assume basic
familiarity with
material of Chapter 1 (mostly set theory). You should read this chapter
on your own
in the first couple of weeks and ask me questions about unclear points.
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A note on proofs</span>. MATH 3354 is
a proof-based course. Everything we discuss in class will be rigorously
proved. More importantly, you are expected not only to understand
proofs, but also to learn how to construct your own proofs and how to
write
proofs&nbsp; (so
that others can understand your argument). It is not expected that you
have taken a proof-based course before MATH 3354. However, MATH 3354
will not include any lectures
devoted specifically to proof writing; instead you will be expected to
develop this skill gradually as we progress through the material. If
you feel that you need a more detalied
introduction to proof writing, you may consider taking MATH 3000
(Transition to Higher Mathematics) before or concurrently with MATH
3354. MATH 3000 is not offered this semester, but is expected
to be offered in Spring 2011.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A note on linear algebra</span>. The
only official prerequisite for this course is MATH 1320. However, you
are <span style="font-style: italic;">strongly encouraged </span>to
take <span style="font-weight: bold;">linear algebra</span> (MATH 3351
or APMA 3080) before or concurrently with MATH 3354. The only formal
linear algebra
skill that will be needed in MATH 3354 is the ability to add and
multiply matrices (this is covered, for instance, in Section 1.6 of our
book). However, some of the mateiral&nbsp; in
MATH 3354 is based on the ideas, which also appear in linear
algebra, but in less abstract setting. Thus, having taken linear
algebra may help you better understand some of the topics in MATH 3354.<br>

<h3>Make-up policy </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Make-ups will be given only under extreme circumstances (such as
serious illness). Except for emergencies, you must obtain my permission
for a make-up before the exam. </li>
  <li>If you miss an exam without a compelling reason, you will
be assigned the score of <b>0</b> on that exam. </li>
  <li>University regulations specifically prohibit early make-ups. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Homework policy</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Homework will be assigned weekly. The assignments will be posted
on the course webpage
and will usually be due on Thursday in class (due dates may be
occasionally changed, e.g. during midterm weeks). </li>
  <li> Please STAPLE your homework. </li>
  <li> No late homework will be accepted. However, three lowest
homework scores will be dropped. </li>
  <li> You are encouraged to work on homework together, but you <i>must</i>
write
up solutions independently, in your own words. In particular,
you should not be consulting others during the process of
writing down your solution.</li>
  <li>GRADING: due to the large class size, it will not be posssible to
grade all homework problems. In each assignment 3-4 selected (but
not announced in advance) problems will be graded for credit. You may
also ask for additional problems in your assignment to be graded (for
feedback only).<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3> Announcements</h3>
