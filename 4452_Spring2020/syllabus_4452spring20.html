<h3> Course outline and prerequisites </h3>

This course is an introduction to the theory of error-correcting codes, that is, codes designed to provide reliable transmission of information in the presence of noise. The topics will include a general theory of linear codes, a detailed discussion of some particular classes of codes (e.g. Hamming codes, BCH codes), and the associated encoding and decoding algorithms. Specific (real life) applications of codes will also be briefly discussed. A few lectures will be devoted to developing necessary algebraic background for the course, mainly basic theory of finite fields. The precise selection of topics will depend on the interests of the students taking the course and may not be determined until a few weeks after the start of the semester.
<br><br>

The official prerequisites for Math 4452 are Math 3351 Elementary Linear Algebra and Math 3354 Survey of Algebra. The linear algebra prerequisite is essential and will be assumed. If you have not taken a prior course in abstract algebra, it is possible to take 4452 if you are willing to learn basic number theory and modular arithmetic (roughly first 4 weeks of 3354) on your own (see, e.g. Lectures 1-9 of my <a href="http://people.virginia.edu/~mve2x/3354_Spring2016/">3354 notes</a>). In addition, a substantial prior exposure to proof-based mathematics will be expected.




<h3>Evaluation </h3> The course grade will be based on homework, two midterms and the final, with weights distributed as follows:
<ul>
<li> homework: 30%
<li> midterms: 20% each
<li> final: 30%
</ul>

<h3>Exams</h3>

The format of the exams has not been finalized at this point, but most likely the final and one of the midterms 
will be in-class while the other midterm will be take-home.
The midterm dates given below are tentative and may be changed later. The date and time of the final
exam is determined by the registrar and cannot be changed (in case the exam is held in class).
<ul>

  <li> First midterm exam: Wed, Feb 26th 

  <li> Second midterm exam: Wed, Apr 10th

  <li> Final exam: Thu, May 7th, 9am-12pm

</ul>

<h3>Make-up policy for exams</h3>

<ul>

  <li>Make-ups or extensions (for take-home exams) will be given only under extreme circumstances (such as

serious illness). Except for emergencies, you must obtain my permission

for a make-up (resp. extension) before the exam (resp. due date). </li>

  <li>If you miss an in-class exam or fail to submit a take-home exam

by the due date without a compelling reason, you will

be assigned the score of <b>0</b> on that exam. </li>

  <li>University regulations specifically prohibit early make-ups. <br>

    <br>

  </li>

</ul>

<h3> Homework </h3> 

<ul> 
<li> Homework will be assigned weekly and will usually be due on Wednesdays, in class. </li>
<li> Please STAPLE your homework. </li>
<li> No late homework will be accepted. However, two lowest
homework scores will be dropped. </li>
<li> GRADING: it will not be possible to grade all homework problems. In each assignment 3-4 selected (but not announced in advance) problems will be graded for credit. 
</ul>



<h3> Collaboration policy on homework. </h3> 
<ul>
<li> On homework:  you are welcome (and even encouraged) 
to work on homework together, but you <i>must</i> write
up solutions independently, in your own words. In particular,
you should not be consulting others during the process of
writing down your solution.

<li> On take-home exams: you MAY NOT discuss problems with other people
or use any resources (including web) except for the class textbook and your
class notes. You may ask me questions about the exam problems, but normally
I will only provide very brief hints. 
</ul>



<h3> Announcements</h3>

Major announcements will be made in class and also posted on the course

webpage.

Some other announcements may only be made by e-mail, so check your

e-mail account

regularly.

<h3> Add/drop/withdrawal dates: </h3>

<ul>

  <li>Monday, January 27 -- Last day to drop a class, add a class, select the AU (audit) option or change to or from "Credit/No Credit" Option</li>


  <li>Monday, March 16 -- Last day to withdraw from a course
 </li>

</ul>

<h3> SDAC </h3>

All students with special needs requiring accommodations should present the appropriate paperwork from
the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC). It is the student's responsibility to present this paperwork in a
timely fashion and follow up with the instructor about the accommodations being offered.  Accommodations
for test-taking (e.g., extended time) should be arranged at least 5 business days before an exam.
