<h2>

Syllabus for Math 4657 (Bilinear Forms and Group Representations), Fall 2017

</h2>

<h3>TuTh 2-3:15 pm, Cabell 207.

</h3>

<ul>

  <li>Instructor: Mikhail Ershov </li>

  <li>Office: Kerchof 302 </li>

  <li>e-mail: ershov <i>at</i> virginia <i>dot</i> edu </li>

  <li>Office hours: 2 hrs 30 min TBA and by APPOINTMENT </li>
   
  <li>Course webpage: &nbsp; <i>http://people.virginia.edu/~mve2x/4657_Fall2017 </i></li> 

</ul>
<h3> Reading </h3> 
<ul>
<li>We will generally follow the <a href="https://pages.shanti.virginia.edu/BF__GR_MATH_5657/">notes</a> by Ben Webster who taught the course in Fall 2015. 
<li >There will also be a <b>required</b> text <i>Representation Theory of Finite Groups: An Introductory Approach</i> by Benjamin Steinberg.  
<li>Here are other recommended books on representation theory: 
<ul>
<li> <i>Linear Representations of Finite Groups </i> by  Jean-Pierre Serre,
<li> <i>Representations and Characters of Groups</i> by  Gordon James and Martin Liebeck.
<li> <i>Representation Theory of Finite Groups</i> by Martin Burrow.
</ul>
</ul>

<h3> Prerequisites </h3> 
The minimal prerequisites for this class are Math 3351 Elementary Linear Algebra and Math 3354 Survey of Algebra. An ideal background involves advanced versions of these classes, Math 4651 Advanced Linear Algebra and Math 4652 Introduction to Abstract Algebra. If you have not taken 4651 and/or 4652, you can still take 4657, but you should be prepared to learn some background material on your own. Also you should expect that the pace in 4657 will be much faster than what you experienced at 3000 level.



<h3>Evaluation </h3> The course grade will be based on homework, two midterms and the final,
with weights distributed as follows:
<ul>
<li> homework: 30% 
<li> midterms: 20% each
<li> final: 30%
</ul>

<h3>Exams</h3>

The format of the exams (in class, take-home or combined) has not been finalized at this point and will be announced later.
The midterm dates given below are tentative and may be changed later. The date and time of the final
exam is determined by the registrar and cannot be changed (in the case of a take-home final
it will be due on that date). 
<ul>

  <li> First midterm exam: Thu, Sep 28th 

  <li> Second midterm exam: Thu, Nov 2nd

  <li> Final exam: Thu, Dec 7th, 9am-12pm

</ul>

<h3>Make-up policy </h3>

<ul>

  <li>Make-ups or extensions (for take-home exams) will be given only under extreme circumstances (such as

serious illness). Except for emergencies, you must obtain my permission

for a make-up (resp. extension) before the exam (resp. due date). </li>

  <li>If you miss an in-class exam or fail to submit a take-home exam

by the due date without a compelling reason, you will

be assigned the score of <b>0</b> on that exam. </li>

  <li>University regulations specifically prohibit early make-ups. <br>

    <br>

  </li>

</ul>

<h3> Homework </h3> 

<ul> 
<li> Homework will be assigned weekly and will usually be due on Thursdays. </li>
<li> Please STAPLE your homework. </li>
<li> No late homework will be accepted. However, two lowest
homework scores will be dropped. </li>
<li> GRADING: it may not be possible to grade all homework problems.
</ul>


<h3> Collaboration policy. </h3> 
<ul>
<li> On homework:  you are welcome (and even encouraged) 
to work on homework together, but you <i>must</i> write
up solutions independently, in your own words. In particular,
you should not be consulting others during the process of
writing down your solution.

<li> On take-home exams: you MAY NOT discuss problems with other people
or use any resources (including web) except for the class textbook and your
class notes. You may ask me questions about the exam problems, but normally
I will only provide very brief hints. 
</ul>




<h3> Announcements</h3>

Major announcements will be made in class and also posted on the course

webpage.

Some other announcements may only be made by e-mail, so check your

e-mail account

regularly.

<h3> Add/drop/withdrawal dates: </h3>

<ul>

  <li>Tuesday, September 5 -- Last day to ADD a course, elect the audit

option,

change the grading option (grade or CR/NC), or establish an independent

study </li>

  <li>Wednesday, September 6 -- Last day to DROP a course (deletion

from the transcript) </li>

  <li>Tuesday, October 17 -- Last day to withdraw from a course

<h3> SDAC </h3>

All students with special needs requiring accommodations should present the appropriate paperwork from
the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC). It is the student's responsibility to present this paperwork in a
timely fashion and follow up with the instructor about the accommodations being offered.  Accommodations
for test-taking (e.g., extended time) should be arranged at least 5 business days before an exam.
